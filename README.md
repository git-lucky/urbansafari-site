## Design system quick reference

The Hybrid 04 design, with Tim's Expedition Passport palette and type.

- Palette: blue `#174F6B`, deep blue `#0E3447`, gold buttons `#E9BE4F`, foil gold text `#E4C77C`, pale paper `#E7EEE9`, light print `#F7F9F7` (tokens in `:root` of `site.css`).
- Rounded squares are the motif (checkpoints, step numbers, icon tiles). Paper sections use the wave pattern; blue "leather" sections add grain.
- Header: the game's geometric elephant left of "Urban Safari". Footer: the gold-and-green Safari Warrior coin and "See you out there."

## Behavior notes

- **Planner** (homepage `#plan` and `/plan/`): four required answers move Atlas along the route. Submitting opens an email draft to mike@urbansafari.app prefilled with the answers; nothing is sent until the visitor sends it. `/plan/` accepts `?city=`, `?style=` (or the older `?package=` slug) and `?occasion=`.
- **Practice hunt** (homepage): five sample challenges scored locally. Chosen photos and videos stay in the browser; nothing is uploaded or stored.
- **City pages** are generated from `src/content/cities.ts` at `/cities/<slug>/`.

## Atlas the mascot

Only the approved images in `public/img/` ship. `MASCOT_SPEC.md` and `MASCOT_PROMPTS.md` are the art-direction notes.
